Rocket is web framework for Rust (nightly) with a focus on ease-of-use,
expressibility, and speed. Here's an example of a complete Rocket application:

```rust
#![feature(plugin, decl_macro)]
#![plugin(rocket_codegen)]

extern crate rocket;

#[get("/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite().mount("/hello", routes![hello]).launch();
}
```

Visiting `localhost:8000/hello/John/58`, for example, will trigger the `hello`
route resulting in the string `Hello, 58 year old named John!` being sent to the
browser. If an `<age>` string was passed in that can't be parsed as a `u8`, the
route won't get called, resulting in a 404 error.

The official community support channels are the `#rocket` IRC channel on the
[Mozilla IRC Server](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) at `irc.mozilla.org` and the
bridged [Rocket room on
Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rocket:matrix.org). If you're not
familiar with IRC, we recommend chatting through [Matrix via
Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rocket:matrix.org) or via the [Kiwi
web IRC client](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mozilla.org/#rocket). You can

## Building

### Nightly

Rocket requires a nightly version of Rust as it makes heavy use of syntax
extensions. This means that the first two unwieldly lines in the introductory
example above are required. Due to an issue in a Rocket dependency (see [#513]),
you must currently build _released_ versions of Rocket with a nightly between
`nightly-2017-12-18` and `nightly-2017-12-21`. The in-development version of
Rocket compiles with the _latest_ nightly compiler.

[#513]: https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/513

### Core, Codegen, and Contrib

All of the Rocket libraries are managed by Cargo. As a result, compiling them is
simple.

  * Core: `cd lib && cargo build`
  * Codegen: `cd codegen && cargo build`
  * Contrib: `cd contrib && cargo build --all-features`

### Examples

Rocket ships with an extensive number of examples in the `examples/` directory
which can be compiled and run with Cargo. For instance, the following sequence
of commands builds and runs the `Hello, world!` example:

```
cd examples/hello_world
cargo run
```

You should see `Hello, world!` by visiting `http://localhost:8000`.

## Testing

To test Rocket, simply run `./scripts/test.sh` from the root of the source tree.
This will build and test the `core`, `codegen`, and `contrib` libraries as well
as all of the examples. This is the script that gets run by Travis CI. To test a
crate individually, run `cargo test --all-features`.

### Core

Testing for the core library is done inline in the corresponding module. For
example, the tests for routing can be found at the bottom of the
`lib/src/router/mod.rs` file.

### Codegen

Code generation tests can be found in `codegen/tests`. We use the
[compiletest](https://crates.io/crates/compiletest_rs) library, which was
extracted from `rustc`, for testing. See the [compiler test
documentation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/COMPILER_TESTS.md)
for information on how to write compiler tests.

## Documentation

You can build the Rocket API documentation locally by running
`./scripts/mk-docs.sh`. The resulting documentation is what gets uploaded to
[api.rocket.rs](https://api.rocket.rs).

## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely, positively welcome and encouraged! Contributions
come in many forms. You could:

  1. Submit a feature request or bug report as an [issue](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues).
  2. Ask for improved documentation as an [issue](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues).
  3. Comment on [issues that require
     feedback](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feedback+wanted%22).
  4. Contribute code via [pull requests](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/pulls).

We aim to keep Rocket's code quality at the highest level. This means that any
code you contribute must be:

  * **Commented:** Public items _must_ be commented.
  * **Documented:** Exposed items _must_ have rustdoc comments with
    examples, if applicable.
  * **Styled:** Your code should be `rustfmt`'d when possible.
  * **Simple:** Your code should accomplish its task as simply and
     idiomatically as possible.
  * **Tested:** You must add (and pass) convincing tests for any functionality you add.
  * **Focused:** Your code should do what it's supposed to do and nothing more.

All pull requests are code reviewed and tested by the CI. Note that unless you
explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in Rocket by you shall be dual licensed under the MIT License and
Apache License, Version 2.0, without any additional terms or conditions.

## Performance

Rocket is designed to be performant. At this time, its performance is
[bottlenecked by the Hyper HTTP
library](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/17). Even so, Rocket
currently performs _significantly better_ than the latest version of
multithreaded asynchronous Hyper on a simple "Hello, world!" benchmark. Rocket
also performs _significantly better_ than the Iron web framework:

**Machine Specs:**

  * **Logical Cores:** 12 (6 cores x 2 threads)
  * **Memory:** 24gb ECC DDR3 @ 1600mhz
  * **Processor:** Intel Xeon X5675 @ 3.07GHz
  * **Operating System:** Mac OS X v10.11.6

**Iron v0.5.0** (11 LOC) results (best of 3, +/- 3000 req/s, +/- 500us latency):

    Running 10s test @ http://localhost:80
      1 threads and 18 connections

    Requests/sec:  57920.73
    Transfer/sec:      8.06MB

**Summary:**

  * Rocket throughput higher by 25.9% (higher is better) compared to Hyper.
  * Rocket throughput higher by 29.6% (higher is better) compared to Iron.
  * Rocket latency lower by 46.8% (lower is better) compared to Hyper.
  * Rocket latency lower by 70.1% (lower is better) compared to Iron.

### Future Improvements

Rocket is currently built on a synchronous HTTP backend. Once the Rust
asynchronous I/O libraries have stabilized, a migration to a new, more
performant HTTP backend is planned. We expect performance to improve
significantly at that time. The [Stabilize HTTP
Library](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/17) issue tracks the
progress on this front.
